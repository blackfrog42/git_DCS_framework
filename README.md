# git_DCS_framework

This framework patches together a a version control system, a typesetting engine, and templating engine (git, LaTeX, and jinja2).

Why?  Inheritance (think CSS for PDF documents), separating document data from presentation, stream line document review and approval process (diff) , and it's all free.  The result should make compliance with ISO and SQF type quality schemes less time consuming.

Planned Features:
	* Sample Templates for inheritance
	* Sample Templates which generate reports from JSON data
	* Generate list of documents automatically
	* Pre-populate commit notes with sugestions from diff
	* Auto-generate (and insert) per-document change logs
	* Sample procedure/SOP for using this system to comply with ISO/SQF review/approval requirements
